arXiv:2509.06694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are universal approximators for continuous functions on compact domains, many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that incur high computational costs....

arXiv:2509.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as media with piecewise c...

**Score**: 1.5

arXiv:2509.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this work, we introduce...

arXiv:2509.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to \mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU neural networks, the exact function realization problem is to determine when some network wit...
